delay times at airports

This program reads an American Airline datafile and displays the number of delays and the length of the delays at each domestic airport.  

The user has the option of adding to or deleting an airport from the datafile.

After adding or deleting airport, click "Yes to All" to complete the action and have the action be reflected in the datafile.

When you add an airport, it automatically places null into the statistics.  The airport is placed in the data file but will not show up on the user interface if you attempt to run the function that shows all airports.
